## Declaring Reactive State

With the Options API, we use the `data` option to declare reactive state of a component. 
The option value should be a function that returns an object. 
Vue will call the function when creating a new component instance, and wrap the returned object in its reactivity system. 
Any top-level properties of this object are proxied on the component instance (`this` in methods and lifecycle hooks):

```js {2-6}
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 1
    }
  },

  // `mounted` is a lifecycle hook which we will explain later
  mounted() {
    // `this` refers to the component instance.
    console.log(this.count) // => 1

    // data can be mutated as well
    this.count = 2
  }
}

```

These instance properties are only added when the instance is first created, so you need to ensure they are all present in the object returned by the `data` function. 
Where necessary, use `null`, `undefined` or some other placeholder value for properties where the desired value isn't yet available.

It is possible to add a new property directly to `this` without including it in `data`. However, properties added this way will not be able to trigger reactive updates.

Vue uses a `$` prefix when exposing its own built-in APIs via the component instance. 
It also reserves the prefix `_` for internal properties. You should avoid using names for top-level `data` properties that start with either of these characters.

### Reactive Proxy vs. Original
In Vue 3, data is made reactive by leveraging [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). 
Users coming from Vue 2 should be aware of the following edge case:

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      someObject: {}
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    const newObject = {}
    this.someObject = newObject

    console.log(newObject === this.someObject) // false
  }
}

```
When you access `this.someObject` after assigning it, you will get a reactive proxy of the original `newObject`. 
**Unlike in Vue 2, the original `newObject` is left intact and will not become reactive. 
Therefore, always ensure that you access the reactive state as a property of `this`**

## Declaring Methods
[Watch a free video lesson on Vue School](https://vueschool.io/lessons/methods-in-vue-3?friend=vuejs)

To add methods to a component instance we use the `methods` option. This should be an object containing the desired methods:

```js {7-11}
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // methods can be called in lifecycle hooks, or other methods!
    this.increment()
  }
}

```
Vue automatically binds the `this` value for `methods` so that it always refers to the component instance. 
This ensures that a method retains the correct `this` value if it's used as an event listener or callback. 
You should avoid using arrow functions when defining `methods`, as that prevents Vue from binding the appropriate `this` value:

```js
export default {
  methods: {
    increment: () => {
      // BAD: no `this` access here!
    }
  }
}
```
Just like all other properties of the component instance, the `methods` are accessible from within the component's template. 
Inside a template they are most commonly used as event listeners:

export const template1 = `
<button @click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
`;

<Code code={template1} lang="vue" />

[Try it in the playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9Uk1rwzAM/SvCp42WdLCdSlb2QQ/bYRvbjr5kjtq6dexgy10g5L/PdkhSWCkY25KeHu9ZbtljXWdHj2zJciesrGnFNTa1sQQlbgqvCFquAcqCiqvr/g5gkbzVQwQgjNe0hJs+7uLRzeNeIe1M6ZYDVGphsUJNExcA7aTLEsVs9p8h5rGc8Al9wpOgXIeVL0YLISCsalUQhggg//FERsODUFIc7jkbCThbtW1vALouX/TA0JQvRgY2Z+SE0Ru5zfbO6PBaSQxnwlS1VGjfa5JGO85Gp5wVSpnf15Qj6zG5ST07FIcz+b1rYo6zD4sO7RE5G2tU2C0GrbG8/nrDJtzHYmVKrwL6QvETnVE+auxhT16XQfYJLql9qeLkpd5+u3VDqN1gKgqdZsJZ+DLPF6xPcm+zu2FArPsDd1nL4A==)

In the example above, the method `increment` will be called when the `<button>` is clicked.

### Deep reactivity
In Vue, [state](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management) is deeply reactive by default. 
This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      obj: {
        nested: { count: 0 },
        arr: ['foo', 'bar']
      }
    }
  },
  methods: {
    mutateDeeply() {
      // these will work as expected.
      this.obj.nested.count++
      this.obj.arr.push('baz')
    }
  }
}
```
### DOM Update Timing

When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. 
However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. 
Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the [nextTick()](https://vuejs.org/api/general.html#nexttick) global API:

```js
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

export default {
  methods: {
    async increment() {
      this.count++
      await nextTick()
      // Now the DOM is updated
    }
  }
}
```

### Stateful Methods
In some cases, we may need to dynamically create a method function, for example creating a debounced event handler:

```js
import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'

export default {
  methods: {
    // Debouncing with Lodash
    click: debounce(function () {
      // ... respond to click ...
    }, 500)
  }
}
```

However, this approach is problematic for components that are reused because a debounced function is stateful: 
it maintains some internal state on the elapsed time. 
If multiple component instances share the same debounced function, they will interfere with one another.

To keep each component instance's debounced function independent of the others, 
we can create the debounced version in the `created` lifecycle hook:

```js
export default {
  created() {
    // each instance now has its own copy of debounced handler
    this.debouncedClick = _.debounce(this.click, 500)
  },
  unmounted() {
    // also a good idea to cancel the timer
    // when the component is removed
    this.debouncedClick.cancel()
  },
  methods: {
    click() {
      // ... respond to click ...
    }
  }
}
```
