## Introduction
Plugins are self-contained code that usually add app-level functionality to Vue. This is how we install a plugin:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp({})

app.use(myPlugin, {
  /* optional options */
})
```
A plugin is defined as either an object that exposes an `install()` method, or simply a function that acts as the install function itself. 
The install function receives the [app instance](https://vuejs.org/api/application.html) along with additional options passed to `app.use()`, if any:

```js
const myPlugin = {
  install(app, options) {
    // configure the app
  }
}
```
There is no strictly defined scope for a plugin, but common scenarios where plugins are useful include:

1. Register one or more global components or custom directives with `app.component()` and `app.directive()`.

2. Make a resource [injectable](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html) throughout the app by calling `app.provide()`.

3. Add some global instance properties or methods by attaching them to `app.config.globalProperties`.

4. A library that needs to perform some combination of the above (e.g. [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/router)).

## Writing a Plugin
To better understand how to create your own Vue.js plugins, 
we will create a very simplified version of a plugin that displays i18n (short for Internationalization) strings.

Let's begin by setting up the plugin object. It is recommended to create it in a separate file and export it, 
as shown below to keep the logic contained and separate.

```js
// plugins/i18n.js
export default {
  install: (app, options) => {
    // Plugin code goes here
  }
}
```
We want to create a translation function. 
This function will receive a dot-delimited `key` string, which we will use to look up the translated string in the user-provided options. 
This is the intended usage in templates:'

export const template1 = `
<h1>{{ $translate('greetings.hello') }}</h1>
`;

<Code code={template1} lang="vue" />

Since this function should be globally available in all templates, we will make it so by attaching it to `app.config.globalProperties` in our plugin:

```js
// plugins/i18n.js
export default {
  install: (app, options) => {
    // inject a globally available $translate() method
    app.config.globalProperties.$translate = (key) => {
      // retrieve a nested property in `options`
      // using `key` as the path
      return key.split('.').reduce((o, i) => {
        if (o) return o[i]
      }, options)
    }
  }
}
```
Our `$translate` function will take a string such as `greetings.hello`, look inside the user provided configuration and return the translated value.

The object containing the translated keys should be passed to the plugin during installation via additional parameters to `app.use()`:

```js
import i18nPlugin from './plugins/i18n'

app.use(i18nPlugin, {
  greetings: {
    hello: 'Bonjour!'
  }
})
```
Now, our initial expression `$translate('greetings.hello')` will be replaced by `Bonjour!` at runtime.

<Aside title="TIP" type="tip">
Use global properties scarcely, since it can quickly become confusing 
if too many global properties injected by different plugins are used throughout an app.

</Aside>

### Provide / Inject with Plugins
Plugins also allow us to use `provide` to give plugin users access to a function or attribute. For example, 
we can allow the application to have access to the `options` parameter to be able to use the translations object.

```js
// plugins/i18n.js
export default {
  install: (app, options) => {
    app.provide('i18n', options)
  }
}
```
Plugin users will now be able to inject the plugin options into their components using the `i18n` key:

```js
export default {
  inject: ['i18n'],
  created() {
    console.log(this.i18n.greetings.hello)
  }
}
```
### Bundle for NPM
If you further want to build and publish your plugin for others to use, see [Vite's section on Library Mode](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode).
