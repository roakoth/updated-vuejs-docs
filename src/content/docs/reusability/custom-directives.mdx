## Introduction

In addition to the default set of directives shipped in core (like `v-model` or `v-show`), Vue also allows you to register your own custom directives.

We have introduced two forms of code reuse in Vue: [components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html) and [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html). Components are the main building blocks, while composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. 
Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.

A custom directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component. 
The hooks receive the element the directive is bound to. 
Here is an example of a directive that adds a class to an element when it is inserted into the DOM by Vue:

```js
const highlight = {
  mounted: (el) => el.classList.add('is-highlight')
}

export default {
  directives: {
    // enables v-highlight in template
    highlight
  }
}
```
export const template1 = `
<p v-highlight>This sentence is important!</p>
`;

<Code code={template1} lang="vue" />

export const template2 = `
This sentence is important!
`;

<Code code={template2} lang="vue" />

Similar to components, custom directives must be registered so that they can be used in templates. 
In the example above, we are using local registration via the `directives` option.

It is also common to globally register custom directives at the app level:

```js
const app = createApp({})

// make v-highlight usable in all components
app.directive('highlight', {
  /* ... */
})
```
## When to use custom directives
Custom directives should only be used when the desired functionality can only be achieved via direct DOM manipulation.

A common example of this is a `v-focus` custom directive that brings an element into focus.

```js
const focus = {
  mounted: (el) => el.focus()
}

export default {
  directives: {
    // enables v-focus in template
    focus
  }
}
```
This directive is more useful than the `autofocus` attribute because it works not just on page load - 
it also works when the element is dynamically inserted by Vue!

Declarative templating with built-in directives such as v-bind is recommended when possible because they are more efficient and server-rendering friendly.

## Directive Hooks
A directive definition object can provide several hook functions (all optional):

```js
const myDirective = {
  // called before bound element's attributes
  // or event listeners are applied
  created(el, binding, vnode) {
    // see below for details on arguments
  },
  // called right before the element is inserted into the DOM.
  beforeMount(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called when the bound element's parent component
  // and all its children are mounted.
  mounted(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is updated
  beforeUpdate(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called after the parent component and
  // all of its children have updated
  updated(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is unmounted
  beforeUnmount(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called when the parent component is unmounted
  unmounted(el, binding, vnode) {}
}
```
### Hook Arguments

Directive hooks are passed these arguments:

- `el`: the element the directive is bound to. This can be used to directly manipulate the DOM.

- `binding`: an object containing the following properties.

      - `value`: The value passed to the directive. For example in `v-my-directive="1 + 1"`, the value would be `2`.
      - `oldValue`: The previous value, only available in `beforeUpdate` and `updated`. It is available whether or not the value has changed.
      - `arg`: The argument passed to the directive, if any. For example in `v-my-directive:foo`, the arg would be `"foo"`.
      - `modifiers`: An object containing modifiers, if any. For example in `v-my-directive.foo.bar`, the modifiers object would be `{ foo: true, bar: true }`.
      - `instance`: The instance of the component where the directive is used.
      - `dir`: the directive definition object.
      - `vnode`: the underlying VNode representing the bound element.
      - `prevVnode`: the VNode representing the bound element from the previous render. Only available in the `beforeUpdate` and `updated` hooks.

As an example, consider the following directive usage:

export const template3 = `
<div v-example:foo.bar="baz">
`;

<Code code={template3} lang="vue" />

The `binding` argument would be an object in the shape of:

```js
{
  arg: 'foo',
  modifiers: { bar: true },
  value: /* value of `baz` */,
  oldValue: /* value of `baz` from previous update */
}
```
Similar to built-in directives, custom directive arguments can be dynamic. For example:

export const template4 = `
<div v-example:[arg]="value"></div>
`;

<Code code={template4} lang="vue" />

Here the directive argument will be reactively updated based on `arg` property in our component state.


<Aside>
Apart from `el`, you should treat these arguments as read-only and never modify them. 
If you need to share information across hooks, it is recommended to do so through element's [dataset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset).
</Aside>

## Function Shorthand

It's common for a custom directive to have the same behavior for `mounted` and `updated`, 
with no need for the other hooks. In such cases we can define the directive as a function:

export const template5 = `
<div v-color="color"></div>
`;

<Code code={template5} lang="vue" />

```js
app.directive('color', (el, binding) => {
  // this will be called for both `mounted` and `updated`
  el.style.color = binding.value
})
```
## Object Literals

If your directive needs multiple values, you can also pass in a JavaScript object literal. 
Remember, directives can take any valid JavaScript expression.

export const template6 = `
<div v-demo="{ color: 'white', text: 'hello!' }"></div>
`;

<Code code={template6} lang="vue" />

```js
app.directive('demo', (el, binding) => {
  console.log(binding.value.color) // => "white"
  console.log(binding.value.text) // => "hello!"
})
```
## Usage on Components

<Aside title="Not recommended" type="caution">
Using custom directives on components is not recommended. Unexpected behaviour may occur when a component has multiple root nodes.
</Aside>

When used on components, custom directives will always apply to a component's root node, similar to [Fallthrough Attributes](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs.html).

export const template7 = `
<MyComponent v-demo="test" />
`;

<Code code={template7} lang="vue" />

export const template8 = `
<!-- template of MyComponent -->

<div> <!-- v-demo directive will be applied here -->
  <span>My component content</span>
</div>
`;

<Code code={template8} lang="vue" />

Note that components can potentially have more than one root node. 
When applied to a multi-root component, a directive will be ignored and a warning will be thrown. 
Unlike attributes, directives can't be passed to a different element with `v-bind="$attrs"`.
