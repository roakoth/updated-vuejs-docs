## Introduction

In addition to the default set of directives shipped in core (like `v-model` or `v-show`), Vue also allows you to register your own custom directives.

We have introduced two forms of code reuse in Vue: [components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html) and [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html). Components are the main building blocks, while composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. 
Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.

A custom directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component. 
The hooks receive the element the directive is bound to. 
Here is an example of a directive that adds a class to an element when it is inserted into the DOM by Vue:

```js
const highlight = {
  mounted: (el) => el.classList.add('is-highlight')
}

export default {
  directives: {
    // enables v-highlight in template
    highlight
  }
}
```
