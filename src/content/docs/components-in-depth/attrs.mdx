## Attribute Inheritance

A "fallthrough attribute" is an attribute or `v-on` event listener that is passed to a component, 
but is not explicitly declared in the receiving component's [props](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html) or [emits](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html#declaring-emitted-events). 
Common examples of this include `class`, `style`, and `id` attributes.

When a component renders a single root element, fallthrough attributes will be automatically added to the root element's attributes. 
For example, given a `<MyButton>` component with the following template:

export const template1 = `
<!-- template of <MyButton> -->
<button>Click Me</button>
`;

<Code code={template1} lang="vue" />

And a parent using this component with:

export const template2 = `
<MyButton class="large" />
`;

<Code code={template2} lang="vue" />

The final rendered DOM would be:

export const template3 = `
<button class="large">Click Me</button>
`;

<Code code={template3} lang="vue" />

Here, `<MyButton>` did not declare `class` as an accepted prop. 
Therefore, `class` is treated as a fallthrough attribute and automatically added to `<MyButton>`'s root element.

### `class` and `style` Merging
If the child component's root element already has existing `class` or `style` attributes, 
it will be merged with the `class` and `style` values that are inherited from the parent. 
Suppose we change the template of `<MyButton>` in the previous example to:

export const template4 = `
<!-- template of <MyButton> -->
<button class="btn">Click Me</button>
`;

<Code code={template4} lang="vue" />

Then the final rendered DOM would now become:


export const template5 = `
<button class="btn large">Click Me</button>
`;

<Code code={template5} lang="vue" />

### `v-on` Listener Inheritance

The same rule applies to `v-on` event listeners:

export const template6 = `
<MyButton @click="onClick" />
`;

<Code code={template6} lang="vue" />

The `click` listener will be added to the root element of `<MyButton>`, 
i.e. the native `<button>` element. When the native `<button>` is clicked, 
it will trigger the `onClick` method of the parent component. 
If the native `<button>` already has a `click` listener bound with `v-on`, then both listeners will trigger.

### Nested Component Inheritance

If a component renders another component as its root node, 
for example, we refactored `<MyButton>` to render a `<BaseButton>` as its root:

export const template7 = `
<!-- template of <MyButton/> that simply renders another component -->
<BaseButton />
`;

<Code code={template7} lang="vue" />

Then the fallthrough attributes received by `<MyButton>` will be automatically forwarded to `<BaseButton>`.

Note that:

1. Forwarded attributes do not include any attributes that are declared as props, 
or `v-on` listeners of declared events by `<MyButton>` - in other words, the declared props and listeners have been "consumed" by `<MyButton>`.

2. Forwarded attributes may be accepted as props by `<BaseButton>`, if declared by it.

## Disabling Attribute Inheritance

If you do not want a component to automatically inherit attributes, you can set `inheritAttrs: 
false` in the component's options.

The common scenario for disabling attribute inheritance is when attributes need to be applied to other elements besides the root node. 
By setting the `inheritAttrs` option to `false`, you can take full control over where the fallthrough attributes should be applied.

These fallthrough attributes can be accessed directly in template expressions as `$attrs`:

export const template8 = `
<span>Fallthrough attributes: {{ $attrs }}</span>
`;

<Code code={template8} lang="vue" />

The `$attrs` object includes all attributes that are not declared by the component's `props` or `emits` options (e.g., `class`, `style`, `v-on` listeners, etc.).

Some notes:

- Unlike props, fallthrough attributes preserve their original casing in JavaScript, so an attribute like `foo-bar` needs to be accessed as `$attrs['foo-bar']`.

A `v-on` event listener like `@click` will be exposed on the object as a function under `$attrs.onClick`.

Using our `<MyButton>` component example from the [previous section](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs.html#attribute-inheritance) - sometimes we may need to wrap the actual `<button>` element with an extra `<div>` for styling purposes:

```js
<div class="btn-wrapper">
  <button class="btn">Click Me</button>
</div>
```
We want all fallthrough attributes like `class` and `v-on` listeners to be applied to the inner `<button>`, not the outer `<div>`. 
We can achieve this with `inheritAttrs: false` and `v-bind="$attrs"`:

export const template9 = `
<div class="btn-wrapper">
  <button class="btn" v-bind="$attrs">Click Me</button>
</div>
`;

<Code code={template9} lang="vue" />

Remember that `v-bind` [without an argument](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.html#dynamically-binding-multiple-attributes) binds all the properties of an object as attributes of the target element.

## Attribute Inheritance on Multiple Root Nodes

Unlike components with a single root node, components with multiple root nodes do not have an automatic attribute fallthrough behavior. 
If `$attrs` are not bound explicitly, a runtime warning will be issued.

export const template10 = `
<div class="btn-wrapper">
  <CustomLayout id="custom-layout" @click="changeValue" />
</div>
`;

<Code code={template10} lang="vue" />

If `<CustomLayout>` has the following multi-root template, 
there will be a warning because Vue cannot be sure where to apply the fallthrough attributes:

export const template11 = `
<header>...</header>
<main>...</main>
<footer>...</footer>
`;

<Code code={template11} lang="vue" />

The warning will be suppressed if `$attrs` is explicitly bound:

export const template12 = `
<header>...</header>
<main v-bind="$attrs">...</main>
<footer>...</footer>
`;

<Code code={template12} lang="vue" />

## Accessing Fallthrough Attributes in JavaScript

If needed, you can access a component's fallthrough attributes via the `$attrs` instance property:

```js
export default {
  created() {
    console.log(this.$attrs)
  }
}
```
